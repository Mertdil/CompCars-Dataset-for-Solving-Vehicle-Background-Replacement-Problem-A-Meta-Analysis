# CompCars-Dataset-for-Solving-Vehicle-Background-Replacement-Problem:-A-Meta-Analysis
Object detection (YOLO), Image segmentation (R-CNN), Replacing the background of the detected vehicle object (ResNET &amp; GAN)

The problem of identifying and changing the background of a vehicle is an image processing problem and is typically solved using the following techniques:

### 1-Object Detection: 
This technique involves detecting the vehicle object in the image and determining its bounding boxes. This technique enables the determination of the location and size of the vehicle, and the region necessary for changing the background can be identified. Deep learning models such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and Mask R-CNN are commonly used techniques for object detection. 
### 2- Image Segmentation: 
This technique helps determine the boundaries of the vehicle in the image. This technique cuts off the connection between the vehicle and the background, making the background change process easier. Deep learning models such as U-Net, FCN, and Mask R-CNN are commonly used techniques for image segmentation.
Image Editing: This technique completely changes the background of the vehicle in the image. This method is useful when the vehicle's boundaries are not known. 
#### 3-Deep learning models such as GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and ResNet are commonly used techniques for image editing.

The CompCars dataset is a widely used dataset for vehicle recognition and classification problems. To change the background of the images in this dataset, either object detection or image segmentation techniques can be used. For example, the Mask R-CNN model combines both object detection and image segmentation operations and may be a suitable option for vehicle background identification and replacement problems.

### Overview:
The Python code example depends on the selected techniques. To change the vehicle background using Mask R-CNN, the Mask R-CNN model must first be trained, and then the model is used to detect vehicle objects and perform the background change operation. The following libraries can be used for this process:
